Modeling of Forest Fires
The worst wildfires seen in decades are burning across Australia, resulting in severe losses to residents. Here, we propose to use difference ways to model the propagation of the wildfire within a certain forest which may be affected by the static spatial distribution of organisms:
1.	The propagation of fires can be modeled over a small domain using the cellular automata model;
2.	Alternatively, a Markov Chain model may characterize the spread of the fire as well.
